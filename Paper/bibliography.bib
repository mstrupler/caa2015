  review = {Free Software is, however, public; it is about making things public
	and freely available to everyone—a “commons,”
	
	
	
	Introduction
	
	What is FS: "Free Software is a set of practices for the distributed
	collabora-
	
	tive creation of software source code that is then made openly and
	
	freely available through a clever, unconventional use of copyright
	law" 
	
	
	"Since about 1998, the practices and ideas of Free Software have extended
	into new realms of life
	
	and creativity: from software to music and film to science, engineer-
	
	ing, and education; from national politics of intellectual property
	
	to global debates about civil society; from UNIX to Mac OS X and
	
	Windows; from medical records and databases to international dis-
	
	ease monitoring and synthetic biology; from Open Source to open
	
	access. Free Software is no longer only about software—it exempli-
	
	fies a more general reorientation of power and knowledge."
	
	
	"I introduce the concept of a “recursive public.” A recursive public
	is a public that is
	
	vitally concerned with the material and practical maintenance and
	modi-
	
	fication of the technical, legal, practical, and conceptual means
	of its
	
	own existence as a public; it is a collective independent of other
	forms of
	
	constituted power and is capable of speaking to existing forms of
	power
	
	through the production of actually existing alternatives."
	
	
	Chapter 1 "Geeks and Recursive Publics"
	
	Author definde recursive (activities of making, maintaining, and modifying
	software and network ; depth of it) and geek.
	
	The settle to explain the contour of the culture of FS "If intuition
	can lead one from geek to geek, from start-up to night-
	
	club, and across countries, languages, and professional orienta-
	
	tions, it can only be due to a shared set of ideas of how things fit
	
	together in the world. These ideas might be “cultural”"
	
	Refers to Taylor and speak of the "social imaginary [...] The concept
	of a social imaginary also avoids the conundrums
	
	created by the concept of “ideology” and its distinction from mate-
	
	rial practice. " with discussion around Ducoeur, Taylor, Geertz.
	
	The explore the concept of Community and Public of geek
