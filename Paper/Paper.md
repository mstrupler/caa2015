# Abstract
To be rewriten
<!--

If 10 years ago it seemed largely irrelevant and out of scope to adopt FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), the setting dramatically changed. Nowadays to address methodological and theoretical issues in archaeology, FOSS are attractive and promise access to powerful toolboxes accompanied with lifelong sustainability. 
An unexpected or unintended outgrowth of the adoption of FOSS is the interaction with FOSS Communities and the philosophy of software development. Such communities "are a global melting pot of diverse professions and skills that contribute to the progression of the goals represented by the software" (Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopaedia, s.v. "Humanitarian-FOSS"). Thus, archaeologist adopting FOSS deals with free, informal and wider communities, so-called FOSS communities. Each software or a specific package develops a community maintaining the software, providing advices, case examples, advertising and developing new tools. Looking for help, new ideas, possibilities of new tasks, reading or collaborate in the development of FOSS give access for archaeologist to others, less formal, but scientific communities. Platforms like Wikipedia or Stack Overflow challenge scientific communication and the reward principle driven by the traditional academic. This paper addresses how FOSS and FOSS-communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. It also takes this different perspectives to look how this framework could enrich and challenge science and more specifically archaeological research.

# INTRODUCTION[^PaperOrigin]
The Open Access movement rises a lot of sympathy among archaeologists. Academia.edu has grown to one of the biggest repository among others for archaeological paper « freely » avaiable, cross cuting boundaries of traditional reading circle[^Academia]. Anyone understand some of the benefits of this avaiability. On the other side, the Free Software movement, where the origins of the Open Access movement is to be situated, is not considered as relevant. However, on going and growing debates about benefits of dynamism in publication available through new informations technologies challenge this position. Why should archaeologist consider the philosophy of Free Software with more awareness?

Even if Free Software is well established inside and outside academia, the advantages of Free software (that is "the 'free' as in 'free speech', and not the 'free' as in 'free beer' ") are not acknowledged[^FreeBeer]. Free software is in many cases (in the imaginary) understood as 'complicated', 'untrustable' or 'non as effective as proprietary software'. Generaly software is considered as a tool to answer questions and the emphasis is put on the results and not on the reuse neither of workflows nor of the collected data.

The aim of this paper is to give a brief overview of the crossing of Free Software with Archaeology. This closer look draws the attention on changes in informations technologies that question knowledge dissemination. Not only Open Access is important to sustain for large access to research outcome but the access to the data and the analysis should be done in transparent and reproducible ways, that are closer to the ethic of scientific research. This will sustain a stronger research environment. 

Firstly, I will introduce the notion of Scientific Community and then I will concentrate on the similarities between Scientific Community and Free Software Community. In a third point, I will examine the concepts of reuse, modulation and reproducibility in archaeology which I will illustrate with two examples.


[^Academia]: [academia.edu](http://academia.edu) is « free to use » but it is not free. The software runnings the site is unknown and there is no API, which would have made possible a queries of the growth of papers tagged with #Archaeology during the last years and assert the quoted sentence of the main text. Untill now, it's just a guess ...

# Precedent Work
The paper of Benjamin Ducke is, to my knowledge, the only article about the relation of Free and Open Source Software and Archaeology (@Ducke2012). He focuses the attention on the problem of 'black boxes' (@Morin2012) and of sustainability for the development of archaeological software. Proprietray software restric the assesment and control of the process and hinder the dissemination of the analysis. All non-detentor of the propietary software are de facto excluded of the reproduction of the analysis. However as stated, his article does not focus on philosophical or social aspect of Free Software. In my take up, I would like to focus narrower on these problems and how access to data questions the methods established in archaeological research.

# Scientific community

Science is cumulative even if is not clear how exactly scientific knowledge accumulates. In any case it is a community endeavour. In this process, the scientific community brings different points of views, diffrent questions and different ways to resolve same problem. The community is a pool of inspiration: interactions encourage innovation and spark ideas about new lines of evidence, new applications, new questions, and alternate explanations. The (reactif, dense, big) interaction of the Scientific community make the scientific knowledge accumulating and becoming "stable" faster[^stable knowledge].  

The scientific community is a motivating force for recognition and respect from peers and control the quality of scientific research by scrutinising the work of other. It's a system of checks and balances that assures that claims are not fraudulent. It's the communication and the open process inside the community that make it stronger. It's not the claim of a unique researcher that make science strong and reliable but true scrutiny and critics of the peers(@Fanelli2013). 


[^stable knowledge]: "Stable knowledge" refers to the process of establishing a fact. (@Latour1979)





# Free Software and Science

Free Software shares a lot of characteristics with science. Both have scrutiny and cumulative knowledge that can be seen in process like peer reviewing, open data subject to validation and replication. There is a strong culture of credit, civility, reputation and communication

The motivations to do Science or Free Software is in many aspects similar: it's a based on the reputation you earn with your work and there is in both cases an ethic to attribute the work (@Kelty2001). In this process of credit and reputation, researcher make their work available to others and researcher become identified with their work. Citations accredit reuse of ideas, concepts (or code). In Free Software or  in Science differences are made according to the status of the contribution (author, contributor, maintainer). Contributions are based on same principles of cumulative knowledge and its reuse, mixing and modulation.

But similarities between Free Software and Science should not hide the differences. Dissimilarities, specificaly "good characteristic of Free Software" challenge in return, what is taken for granted in science .


# Modifiability

The concept of modifiability is without any doubt the most fascinating concept among the dissimilarities between Science and Free Software (@Kelty2008: 12). Books and articles have acclimatised science making with stable knowledge. The impression given by books or articles is that of a definitive version, "palpable" under the fingers. But Free Software with practices like forking, new versioning, cloning, constant evolution of source code questions this concept. Every "newly avaible" operating system, even prorietary, contains older pieces of software.

On top of the drawing (), a representation of the current way of doing research with a stable knowledge: results are only used, when they are stable. At the bottom a prospect on how software development looks like and how science could be made. The process of sharing knowledge and reusing is becoming more dynamic. However this poses a question. If the content does not need any more to be stable and it is uses like Free Software, "how should the authority, stability and reliability of knowledge be assessed" (@Kelty2008:300)?  In this sense FS challenges the 'Power of Knowledge'[^PowerOfKnowledge].

[^PowerOfKnowledge]: I refer to the expression of C. Kelty is his book, Two Bits [@Kelty2008]

# FS challenges the Power of Knowledge 

New practices of publication with the appearance of new information technologies render the knowledge more dynamic (@Vinck2014). Wikipedia is the most famous example with content that can be updated, changed, deleted, copied, forked at any time by anyone. The last 10 years have seen a complete revaluation of Wikipedia at the University. 10 years ago, as I saw it in France, it was mostly rejected as "untrustable source". Now professors explained how to use it scientifically and foundator of Wikipedia reviece a PhD honoras causis[Make your PhD]

Even if there is a growing discussion on dynamic publication there are still few examples of workflows in academia.  The model proposed by Kansa and other -- "Push and Publish"-- has a nice future for him "beaux jours devant lui" (@Kansa2014). In this model, data are published on-line and may be updated, completed, corrected, cloned after the first online release. Repository number and digitaö archiving is growing that makes possible new dissemination methods.

By looking at the practice of Free Software, it is easier to ask how authority is established and question the finality of publication. Free Software focus not only on the results (the Software) but moves the attention on how softwar work, on the possibility to be controlled and reused. Free Softwar permit to the computational archeaology to not only focus on the results but  broads (élargit) the attention consequently on how evidence. FS is the only way to reconcile digitally the ethic of science and the establishing of facts. It's with this sense in mind, that I will look at reproducibility in archaeology.

# Reproducibility

- Research Pipeline

Reproducibility allows anyone to start from the same data, check all the process in order to verify the results. In Archaeology there is no culture of exchanging code for reproducibility until now, even if it is changing(SAS Session quote). If we turn back to the definition of science, however, reproducibility and sharing of code is even the sine qua non for science, to permit the community to scrutinise the work. "We often forget that scientific knowledge is reliable not because scientists are more clever, objective or honest than other people, but because their claims are exposed to criticism and replication." [@Fanelli 2013] 

For computational research R[ ]  permit to knitt together data, code, and results[Gandrud]. Reproducibility must be attain to stay close to the ethic of science and has a huge potential for empirical research, like in Archaeology. Reproducibility is important for the reuse of data and maintains up to data (analysis). If the data are updated as in the Published in Push model then the computation must be updated too if we want to always gain access to updated results, and not only as the state as published.

Reproducibility gain to transform knoledgw in more modulable way: blurring communities border and pedagogy.



## Pedagogy

First of all FS have a pedagogical aspect that you can not find with others software. 

To read the code, and more precisely to read commented code allows to learn quickly. Some says about FS 

    "In pedagogical terms, Windows is to fish as UNIX is to fishing lessons (Kelty 2008: 132)".

One of the most classical book in FS is the Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition. This a commentary of the V6 of UNIX that has been used by thousands of students to understand how UNIX works. Making Literate Programming gives the opportunity to  

    " concentrate [...] on explaining  to *human beings* what we want a computer to do" [@Knuth1984: 97].

The followings examples for Archaeology (- Note:) I speak mostly of R because it's one of the software I know the best:

  - David L. Carlson: An R Companion to Quantifying Archaeology by Stephen Shennan. It's a comment with code of the work of Shennan that make easier to access the knowledge of Shennan. Most importantly it allows then to modulate the code to use it quickly for your own research question

  - Quantitative Archaeology from the  wiki at "iosa.it" is based exactly on the same principles, with explanation of books and code for archaeologist and offers the possibility of reuse and modulation.

In Pedagogical term reproducibility is a big help to approach different knowledge, and this practice fit perfectly in DIY-workflows. In this case, availability of code  and comment make learning of statistic for archaeologists more experimental. Even if the learning curve is steep it's not a wall. FS in archaeology should be more often stressed as a paradigmatic pedagogical object. I think there is a lot of advocacy, that should be done with this line of argumentation for spreading of FS.

Now I will move to my second point on the challenge provided by FS: that is blurring borders.




# Blurring borders
![iosa](Images/RSealProject.png)
<footer class="source">Image: [Néhémie Strupler](http://nehemie.github.io/CachetsHittites) </footer>

As I showed at the beginning of my talk, community is important for mixing ideas, innovation and motivation. The modularity of FS ease the blurring of academic borders in unpredictable ways. As an example, I present my work on Hittite seals (that can be accessed on Github). I started a project on seals, created a data-base and made the analysis with R. I was mainly working on multivariate analysis. I presented my work during an R Conference in Lyon 2013 and I earn a lot of feedback. It is in this sense, that the using of FS pushes to communicate with informal and wider communities. FS and FS-communities provide a common language and a common goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. 
Eventually, the dataset, the code and my questions served for Bachelor thesis in statistical modelling (from Helene Lombard and Lise Radoszycki). Then, They send me the results with the code and we are now contributing to transform our work into an on-line repository (work is on-going).  This example shows that borders are not just blurred in one way (that is archaeologists need statisticians) but in the other way around too (Statisticians gain at looking data throw the eyes of archaeologists)

Reproducibility, that is, the exposing of the process with the results, transform the possibility of modulation of knowledge. By providing a common language, FS creates new transversal communities that makes science stronger.




# Conclusion

In this presentation I wanted to explore the relation of FS with archaeology. It's a first try for me to give a bigger picture and it is mainly based on my own practice. I hope to have been able to show some of the effects of FS in Science and Archaeology and the perspectives that are now open. FS challenge the authority of science and provide a mean to transform archaeology by questioning transmission and reuse of knowledge. Reproducibility makes all the research pipeline available to the scrutiny of the community by reconciling data, process and results. Finally I would like to stress our responsibility to make further advocacy of FS in archaeology, and to make it louder of this three points: 
 - FS makes science stronger
 - It is a pedagogical object
 - It encourages innovation 

Thank you very much for listening.  I would now like to give you the opportunity to ask questions.
