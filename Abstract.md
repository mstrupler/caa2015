FOSS communities workaround meet archaeology

If 10 years ago it seemed largely irrelevant and out of scope to adopt FOSS the setting dramatically changed. Nowadays to address methodological and theoretical issues in archaeology, FOSS is attractive and promise an access to powerful toolboxes accompanied with a lifelong sustainability. One of the byproducts of the use of FOSS in archaeology is the engagement in completely free, informal and wider communities, so-called FOSS communities. Each software or a specific package develops a community maintaining the software, providing advice, case example, advertising and developing new tools. Looking for help, reading from contributors or participating in the development of FOSS give access for archaeologist other, less formal, scientific worlds. Platforms like Wikipedia or Stack Overflow challenge scientific communication and reward principle driven by the traditional academic. In this paper, I address how FOSS and FOSS communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are (re) visited and same models are seen from different perspectives enriching and challenging among other archaeological research.
