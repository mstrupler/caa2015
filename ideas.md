Abstract
If 10 years ago it seemed largely irrelevant and out of scope to adopt FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), the setting dramatically changed. Nowadays to address methodological and theoretical issues in archaeology, FOSS are attractive and promise access to powerful toolboxes accompanied with lifelong sustainability. 
An unexpected or unintended outgrowth of the adoption of FOSS is the interaction with FOSS Communities and the philosophy of software development. Such communities "are a global melting pot of diverse professions and skills that contribute to the progression of the goals represented by the software" (Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopaedia, s.v. "Humanitarian-FOSS"). Thus, archaeologist adopting FOSS deals with free, informal and wider communities, so-called FOSS communities. Each software or a specific package develops a community maintaining the software, providing advices, case examples, advertising and developing new tools. Looking for help, new ideas, possibilities of new tasks, reading or collaborate in the development of FOSS give access for archaeologist to others, less formal, but scientific communities. Platforms like Wikipedia or Stack Overflow challenge scientific communication and the reward principle driven by the traditional academic. This paper addresses how FOSS and FOSS-communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. It also takes this different perspectives to look how this framework could enrich and challenge science and more specifically archaeological research.




Archaeological Science as Community Enterprise
 
Good morning, my name is Néhémie, I am a PhD student in Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Strasbourg and working Part Time at the German Archaeological Institute in Istanbul. I am working on the Bronze Age Capital of the Hittite, Hattusa, in Central Anatolia Turkey - So far for the self-promotion. In my talk, I am going to explore the ways FS influence the practices of reuse and mixing of knowledge in archaeology. I will focus on some challenges for scholars, especially the problem of reproducibility. This general frame of reference based on practices of reusing and of mixing will provide the background to look closer at the impact of reproducibility in Archaeology, for which I will show some examples.

MOTIVATION: First of all, some words on my motivations: I am always disappointed  when I speak of FS, because people don't understand why FS are important. In this talk, I won't give revolutionary facts, but I have tried to make clear how FS already influenced scientific research in general AND in archaeology. As a young scientist, I need to be prepared to make a strong statement to defend my opinions and the why I use FS in my PhD. If FS are in 2015 well established inside an outside academia, the advantages of Free software (The 'free' as in 'free speech', and not the 'free' as in 'free beer') are not acknowledged. I took the opportunity of this session to try to take a bigger look on the picture.


SUMMARY
Let me briefly outline my talk. We will progress as follow: 
    First I will introduce the notion of Scientific Community 
    Then I will concentrate on the similarities between Scientific Community and Free Software Community ...
    In a Third point I will examine the concept of Reuse, Modulation and Reproducibility in Archaeology
    Finally I will show 2 examples to illustrate the impact of the FS movement on Archaeology ...
    before I recap the main arguments in a conclusion


I begin my talk by briefly outlining what is a scientific community  in order to stand out the similarities and the differences with FS in a second part

1)Why is the scientific community so important?

  Science is cumulative 
  Science is cumulative even if how exactly scientific knowledge accumulate is not clear. In any case it is a community endeavour. Matt Might choosed to represent   human knowledge as a circle in his webcomic, what is a PhD. New Knowledge (like a PhD) should extend the boundary of knowledge.   
  
  Point of views
  In this process, the scientific community bring different points of views and make the scientific knowledge accumulating and becoming "stable" faster. (I choose   the word "stable knowledge" to avoid "truth knowledge" in reference to the process of establishing a fact (I refer here to the work of Bruno Latour and others). Scientists from diverse backgrounds bring many points of view to bear on scientific problems.  Scientists from different backgrounds choose to investigate different questions, but they may approach the same question in different ways.
  
  Diversity invigorates problem solving. 
  A diverse community generate new research methods, explanations, ideas and shed new light on problems. Science benefits from practitioners with diverse beliefs, backgrounds, and values to balance out the biases. Scientists strive to be impartial and objective in their assessments of scientific issues, and biases are better checked by a diverse scientific community.





2) Which are the functions served by the community
Quickly the Scientific community serves three functions (that we can all observe in this session) (the photography is just a place holder)

Inspiration. 
Firstly it's a pool of inspiration: interactions encourage innovation and spark ideas about new lines of evidence, new applications, new questions, and alternate explanations. 

Motivation.
Secondly it's a motivating force for the recognition and respect from peers
			
Scrutiny. 
Thirdly scientific community scrutinise the work of other to assess and control the quality of scientific research. It's a system of system of checks and balances that assures that evidence is

=I’d like to recapitulate on the Scientific Community: it's the communication and the open process inside the Community that make it stronger. It's not the claim of a unique researcher that make science strong and reliable but true scrutiny and critics of the peers. 

After this look on scientific community, I would like to move on to FS





3) FS and Free Science

Free Softwares share a lot of characteristic with science: both have
 - Scrutiny and Cumulative Knowledge that can be seen in process like peer review, open data subject to validation and replication
 - Community provides diversity of points of views, motivation, inspiration. In FS there is a strong culture of credit, civility, reputation and communication

->  The motivations to do Science or FS is often seen to be in many aspects similar: it's a based on the reputation you earn with your work and there is in both cases an ethic to attribute the work (Kelty 2001) In this process of credit and reputation, researcher make their work available to others and researcher becomes identified with their work. Citation then acknowledge/accredit reuse of ideas / concepts /code. In the FS movement code is published and accredited as author / contributor when the code it's used / reused / modified. Free Software and Science are based on the same principle of cumulative knowledge, reuse, remixing and modulation. 

BUT similarities between Free Software and Science should not hide the differences. The similarities make easier to compare both community, better understand them, to see how they work and how they are structured. Then, it's the dissimilarities that help better understand how they work. FS impress  due to the size of projects, indirect cooperation with people all around the world, the way project are developed, maintained, contested, and how ideas are exchanged. These dissimilarities challenge in return, what is taken for granted in science . 



4) Modifiability

The concept of modifiability is without any doubt the most fascinating concept among the dissimilarities between Science and Free Software (Kelty 2008: 12). Books and articles have acclimatized science making with stable knowledge. The impression given by a book or an article is that you have a definitive version  in your hand (Archaeologists speak mostly of "end publication" to contrast with "on going report"). But FS with practices like forking, new versioning, constant evolution of the source code interrogate this concept. 

On the top of the drawing, a representation of the actual way of doing research with a stable knowledge: you only use something, when you know it's stable. At the bottom a prospect on how software developpement looks like a how science could be made. However this pose a question: If the content does not need to be stable any more and are use like Free Software, how should the authority, stability and reliability of knowledge be assessed?  FS Challenge the Power of Knowledge

<!--
"How should the authority, stability, and reliability of knowledge be assessed when work can be rendered permanently modifiable? (Kelty 2008:300) "
-->


5) FS Challenge the Power of Knowledge (See the book of C. Kelty for a longer developpement on this subject)

New practices of publication with the appearance of new information technologies render the knowledge more dynamic (@Vinck2014). Wikipedia is the most famous example with a content that can be updated, changed, deleted, copied, forked at any time by anyone. The last 10 years have seen a complete revaluation of Wikipedia at the University. 10 years ago, as I saw it, it was mostly rejected as "untrustable source". For example, as I started as undergraduate, Professors were more or less forbidding the usage of Wikipedia, but some years after same professor explain how to use scientifically Wikipedia, and some years after they started to actively contribute to it. 

Wikipedia reveals how complex the system of evaluation of the knowledge is and how this system is now challenged thanks to FS. Even if there is a growing discussion on dynamic publishing there are still few examples of new workflow in the academia. As an example for archaeology Eric Kansa advocates for his "Push and Publish" workflow (@Kansa2014).

FS ask how authority is established and question the finality of publication. Contents in constant dynamic, the biggest strength in FS, give the opportunity to better challenge the stability of science. Most importantly, if the focus is not only on the results (stable knowledge), then is moves the attention to how you transmit your workflow. 

Here is the point where, I will turn back to archaeology: I tackled about FS to see how it influenced the way we are doing science, to expose precisely how FS enlarge the attention not only on the results but on the HOW TO. FS is the only way to reconcile the process of making science with the results. It's with this sense in mind, that I will look at reproducibility in archaeology.



6) Reproducibility

Reproducibility allow anyone to start from the same data and to arrive at to check all the process until the results. In this slide I show how reproducibility is possible with the Software R using Literate Statistical Analysis. Starting with Idea and data, all the process are knitted together and allow different ouput.  In Archaeology there is no culture of exchanging code for reproducibility until now even if it is changing. If we turn back to the definition of science, reproducibility and sharing of code is even the sine qua non for the science, to permit the community to scrutinise the work: 

« We often forget that scientific knowledge is reliable not because scientists are more clever, objective or honest than other people, but because their claims are exposed to criticism and replication.» [@Fanelli 2013] 

Code is necessary to critic, explore and reuse the work (scrutinise). Can we go until to ask if that is misconduct, not to provide (free) code? The point of Fanelli is made in an context about misconduct and false claim in Science).

Reproducibility is one of the key aspect that challenge science and I will now expose the benefits of reproducibility for Archaeology.  Besides  to  be a better practice of science, reproducibility is important for:
 - First Pedagogy  
 - Second Blurring the community borders 



7) Pedagogy. 

First of all FS have a pedagogical aspect that you can't find with others software. 

To read the code, and more precisely to read commented code allow to learn quickly. Some says about FS "In pedagogical terms, Windows is to fish as UNIX is to fishing lessons. (Kelty 2008: 132)". One of the most classical book in FS is the Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition. This a commentary of the V6 of UNIX that has been used by thousands of students to understand how UNIX works. Making Literate Programming , that is " concentrate [...] on explaining  to *human beings" what we want a computer to do" [@Knuth1984: 97] give the opportunity to concentrate on the process.

There are examples for Archaeology - Note: I speak mostly of R because it's one of the software I know the best - 
    David L. Carlson: An R Companion to Quantifying Archaeology by Stephen Shennan. 
    It's a comment of the work of Shennan that make easier to access the knowledge of Shennan. Most importantly it allow then to hack (modulate) the code to use it quickly for your own research question
    Quantitative Archaeology Wiki  from isoa.it too. Exactly the same with possibility of reuse.

In Pedagogical term Reproducibility is a big help to approach different knowledge, and it is perfect for a DIY practice. In this case, code makes learning of statistic for archaeologist more experimental. Even if the learning curve is steep it's not a wall! FS in archaeology must be more often stressed as a paradigmatic pedagogical object. I think there is a lot of advocacy to do in this direction.

Now I will move to my second point on the challenge provided by FS: blurring the border.



8) Blurring the border

As I show at the beginning of my talk, community is important for mixing ideas, innovation and motivation. The modularity of FS ease the blurring of academic borders in unpredictable ways. As an example, I present my work on Hittite seals (to be seen on Github). I started a project with R on seals and created a data base with some code and I was mainly working with multivariate analysis. I presented my work during an R Conference in Lyon and I earn a lot of feedback. It is in this sense, that the using of FOSS push to communicate with an informal and wider communities. FS and FS-communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. 
Eventually my dataset, code and my questions served as a Bachelor thesis in statistical modelling (Lombard, Radoszycki). Then, I came back with the results and we are now contributing to transform the work in an on-line repository (work is on-going).  This example shows that the borders are not just blurred in one way (that is archaeologists need statisticians) but in the other way around too (Statistician gain at looking data throw the eyes of archaeologists)

Reproducibility, that is, the exposing of the process with the results, transform the possibility of modulation of knowledge. By providing a common language, FS create new transversal communities that makes science stronger.




9) The Conclusion

In this presentation I wanted to explore the relation of FS with archaeology. It's a first try for me to give a bigger picture on my own practice. I hope to have been able to show that the effect of FS in Science and Archaeology and the perspectives that are now open. FS challenge the authority of science and provide a mean to transform archaeology, transmission of information, reuse. My talk aims to highlight too the need for further advocacy for FS in archaeology. FS challenge knowledge transmission but are pedagogical objects and are the only possibility to make all the research pipeline available by reconciling data, process and results.

Thank you very much for listening.  I would now like to give you the opportunity to ask questions.
