discussing the merits, challenges and drawbacks that the FOSS movement in archaeology has brought to the wider discipline
 ->  the actual impact of FOSS on archaeological practice


If 10 years ago it seemed largely irrelevant and out of scope to adopt FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), the setting dramatically changed. Nowadays to address methodological and theoretical issues in archaeology, FOSS are attractive and promise access to powerful toolboxes accompanied with lifelong sustainability. 
* An unexpected or unintended outgrowth of the adoption of FOSS is the interaction with FOSS Communities and the philosophy of software development. Such communities "are a global melting pot of diverse professions and skills that contribute to the progression of the goals represented by the software" (Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, s.v. "Humanitarian-FOSS"). Thus, archaeologist adopting FOSS deals with free, informal and wider communities, so-called FOSS communities. Each software or a specific package develops a community maintaining the software, providing advices, case examples, advertising and developing new tools. Looking for help, new ideas, possibilities of new tasks, reading or collaborate in the development of FOSS give access for archaeologist to others, less formal, but scientific communities.*
Platforms like Wikipedia or Stack Overflow challenge scientific communication and the reward principle driven by the traditional academic. This paper addresses how FOSS and FOSS-communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. It also takes this different perspectives to look how this framework could enrich and challenge science and more specifically archaeological research.




Intro:
1) Philosophy of FOSS and philosophy of Science (Free Science, C. Kelty)
Use extended definition of Free Software. Introdcution of Recursive Public
 - Development of FOSS
 -  Is there really no Influence in Archaology? Whole concept of sharing in there: yeah may be not only specific on archaeology
 - Copyright and copyleft are challenging

2) Role of community 
 - Exchange, new ideas -> line of codes // articles | blogpost How To Do | Tutorials ...
 - Where we are lookgin for ideas to cope with big data
 - Not easy to find friend to play with ...

3) Examples
   - R 
Calcolatory: R 
  - Wikipedia 
  -QGIS will be one of this example
(Graham and Mirko Novàk)
LA communanauté qui définit et détermine la qualité
Today we are faced with a situation where publication has become trivial, but verification and the management"

4) What can Archaeology do for FOSS
Philo of FOSS is to give back: aknowledge, promote and engage wit FOSS. Use Archaeology for FOSS.

Price of FOSS conference: is that real ??? 450 Euros ???
-> would have  liked to see "Our sessino is open to everyone with our without monetary retribution"





The scientific community: Diversity makes the difference

People from all over the world from all sorts of different cultures and backgrounds are a part of the scientific community.  Scientists from such diverse backgrounds bring many points of view to bear on scientific problems.  Scientists have different strengths and different interests. Not only do people from different backgrounds choose to investigate different questions, but they may approach the same question in different ways. 

Diversity invigorates problem solving. 
Science benefits greatly from a community that approaches problems in a variety of creative ways. A diverse community is better able to generate new research methods, explanations, and ideas, which can help science over challenging hurdles and shed new light on problems. Science benefits from practitioners with diverse beliefs, backgrounds, and values to balance out the biases that might occur if science were practiced by a narrow subset of humanity. Scientists strive to be impartial and objective in their assessments of scientific issues, but in those occasional cases in which personal biases sneak in, they are kept in check by a diverse scientific community.


Science: A community enterprise
Most large-scale human endeavors involve a supporting community rely on diverse communities with different members fulfilling different roles. And science is no exception. The scientific community is made up of researchers, students, lab technicians, the people who work at scientific journals, employees at funding agencies — in short, anyone who helps science govern itself and move forward.
In How science works, we briefly summarized some of the nitty-gritty, day-to-day functions served by the scientific community. Here, we elaborate on those and discuss broader functions served by the community:


Inspiration. 
Community-level interactions encourage innovation and spark ideas about new lines of evidence, new applications, new questions, and alternate explanations. For example, James Watson and Francis Crick came up with a new and brilliant idea for the structure of DNA, but that idea did not come out of the blue. The idea was sparked by evidence that many other scientists (including Linus Pauling, Erwin Chargaff, Maurice Wilkins, and especially Rosalind Franklin) discovered and made available to the scientific community prior to the Watson/Crick model.


Motivation.
 Some people are driven by the thrill of competition — swimmers swim faster, politicians campaign harder, and students study more for college entrance exams when they know that they are competing against others. Scientists are no exception. Some scientists are motivated by the sense of competition offered by the community (e.g., rival teams racing to unlock the sequence of the human genome). Similarly, the community offers scientists the prospect of recognition from their peers. In science, achievement is usually measured, not in terms of money or titles, but in terms of respect and esteem from colleagues. The idea of uncovering a new line of evidence relating to the Big Bang is motivating in and of itself, but many scientists also appreciate the respect from other scientists that making such a discovery would engender. In science, both competition and recognition from the community encourage going out on a limb, testing a new idea, creative thinking, and plain old hard work.

			
				

Division of labor.
 Science is simply too broad for an individual on his or her own to handle! Even research within a single narrow field (e.g., cellular biology) may cover an immense array of specialized topics, from the chemical details of decoding DNA to cellular communication. That specialized knowledge is divided up among different researchers, who may then share their expertise by working together. Collaborations and division of labor are increasingly important today, as our scientific understanding, techniques, and technologies expand. There's simply more to know than ever before! And as we learn more about the world, more research is performed at the intersections of different fields: chemical reactions within cellular organelles, the mathematics of protein folding, the interplay between Earth's geologic history and biological evolution, or the physics of snail locomotion. Such cross-disciplinary studies are better approached by a team of experts from different fields than by a single individual struggling to keep up-to-date with too many topics.


A cumulative knowledge base. 
Science builds on itself. We wouldn't have general relativity if we didn't have classical mechanics. And we wouldn't have classical mechanics if we didn't have Galileo’s studies of motion and revolutionary ideas about astronomy. A similar deep history spanning hundreds of years could be given for almost any scientific idea. The scientific community provides the cumulative knowledge base on which science is built.

Scrutiny. 
Participating in the scientific community involves scrutinizing the work of others and allowing your own work to be similarly evaluated by your peers. This system of checks and balances verifies the quality of scientific research and assures that evidence is 




A Generic Conference Talk Outline

This conference talk outline is a starting point, not a rigid template. Most good speakers average two minutes per slide (not counting title and outline slides), and thus use about a dozen slides for a twenty minute presentation.

    Title/author/affiliation (1 slide)
    Forecast (1 slide)
    Give gist of problem attacked and insight found (What is the one idea you want people to leave with? This is the "abstract" of an oral presentation.)
    Outline (1 slide)
    Give talk structure. Some speakers prefer to put this at the bottom of their title slide. (Audiences like predictability.)
    Background
        Motivation and Problem Statement (1-2 slides)
        (Why should anyone care? Most researchers overestimate how much the audience knows about the problem they are attacking.)
        Related Work (0-1 slides)
        Cover superficially or omit; refer people to your paper.
        Methods (1 slide)
        Cover quickly in short talks; refer people to your paper. 
    Results (4-6 slides)
    Present key results and key insights. This is main body of the talk. Its internal structure varies greatly as a function of the researcher's contribution. (Do not superficially cover all results; cover key result well. Do not just present numbers; interpret them to give insights. Do not put up large tables of numbers.)
    Summary (1 slide)
    Future Work (0-1 slides)
    Optionally give problems this research opens up.
    Backup Slides (0-3 slides)
    Optionally have a few slides ready (not counted in your talk total) to answer expected questions. (Likely question areas: ideas glossed over, shortcomings of methods or results, and future work.
