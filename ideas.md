discussing the merits, challenges and drawbacks that the FOSS movement in archaeology has brought to the wider discipline
 ->  the actual impact of FOSS on archaeological practice


If 10 years ago it seemed largely irrelevant and out of scope to adopt FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), the setting dramatically changed. Nowadays to address methodological and theoretical issues in archaeology, FOSS are attractive and promise access to powerful toolboxes accompanied with lifelong sustainability. 
* An unexpected or unintended outgrowth of the adoption of FOSS is the interaction with FOSS Communities and the philosophy of software development. Such communities "are a global melting pot of diverse professions and skills that contribute to the progression of the goals represented by the software" (Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, s.v. "Humanitarian-FOSS"). Thus, archaeologist adopting FOSS deals with free, informal and wider communities, so-called FOSS communities. Each software or a specific package develops a community maintaining the software, providing advices, case examples, advertising and developing new tools. Looking for help, new ideas, possibilities of new tasks, reading or collaborate in the development of FOSS give access for archaeologist to others, less formal, but scientific communities.*
Platforms like Wikipedia or Stack Overflow challenge scientific communication and the reward principle driven by the traditional academic. This paper addresses how FOSS and FOSS-communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. It also takes this different perspectives to look how this framework could enrich and challenge science and more specifically archaeological research.

The scientific community: Diversity makes the difference

People from all over the world from all sorts of different cultures and backgrounds are a part of the scientific community. At some points in history, science has largely been the domain of white males, but that is simply no longer true. A glance at the authors on recent papers in top scientific journals confirms that diversity is now the norm. Rajsapan Jain, Khayrul Kabir, Joe Gilroy, Keith Mitchell, Kin-chung Wong, and Robin Hicks collaborate on high temperature magnets. Nerilie Abram, Michael Gagan, Zhengyu Liu, Wahyoe Hantoro, Malcolm McCulloch, and Bambang Suwargadion collaborate on ocean-atmosphere interactions. And Jane Carleton and her team of 64 researchers in 10 different countries around the world collaborate on the genome sequences of disease pathogens. Many of these scientists come from different societal cultures and geographic regions; however, in their research, they are all united by the global culture of science. Science is truly without borders.

Scientists from such diverse backgrounds bring many points of view to bear on scientific problems. The 24-year-old chemistry graduate student from South Africa, the 41-year-old fisheries biologist from Florida, and the 65-year-old paleontologist from Beijing probably all have quite different perspectives on the world, and science benefits from such diversity.

Diversity facilitates specialization.
Scientists have different strengths and different interests. Not only do people from different backgrounds choose to investigate different questions, but they may approach the same question in different ways. So, the biologist with a penchant for math, the biologist with an interest in human behavior, and the biologist who can't get enough of microscopes and lab work can all focus on their strengths. While each might choose to tackle the same topic (say, human cognition), they will do so from different angles, contributing to a more complete understanding of the topic.



Diversity invigorates problem solving. 
Science benefits greatly from a community that approaches problems in a variety of creative ways. A diverse community is better able to generate new research methods, explanations, and ideas, which can help science over challenging hurdles and shed new light on problems. For example, Albert Einstein approached the notions of space and time in a very different way from his contemporaries, coming up with ideas that, though unintuitive, were supported by evidence and opened up new areas of research.



Diversity balances biases. 
Science benefits from practitioners with diverse beliefs, backgrounds, and values to balance out the biases that might occur if science were practiced by a narrow subset of humanity. As an example, consider the ongoing scientific investigation of climate change. With such a hot-button issue, personal beliefs about the environment, the economy, business, and politics could unwittingly bias one's search for or assessment of the evidence. But science relies on a diverse community, whose personal views run the gamut: liberal to conservative, tree-hugging to business-friendly, and all sorts of combinations thereof. Scientists strive to be impartial and objective in their assessments of scientific issues, but in those occasional cases in which personal biases sneak in, they are kept in check by a diverse scientific community.



So science depends on diversity. 
If scientists were all the same, scientific controversy would be rare, but so would scientific progress! Despite their diversity, all of those individual scientists are part of the same scientific community and contribute to the scientific enterprise in valuable ways. 



Science: A community enterprise
Most large-scale human endeavors involve a supporting community. From high schools to dairy farms, political parties to professional snowboarding competitions — they all rely on diverse communities with different members fulfilling different roles. And science is no exception. The scientific community is made up of researchers, students, lab technicians, the people who work at scientific journals, employees at funding agencies — in short, anyone who helps science govern itself and move forward.
In How science works, we briefly summarized some of the nitty-gritty, day-to-day functions served by the scientific community. Here, we elaborate on those and discuss broader functions served by the community:


Inspiration. 
Community-level interactions encourage innovation and spark ideas about new lines of evidence, new applications, new questions, and alternate explanations. For example, James Watson and Francis Crick came up with a new and brilliant idea for the structure of DNA, but that idea did not come out of the blue. The idea was sparked by evidence that many other scientists (including Linus Pauling, Erwin Chargaff, Maurice Wilkins, and especially Rosalind Franklin) discovered and made available to the scientific community prior to the Watson/Crick model.


Motivation.
 Some people are driven by the thrill of competition — swimmers swim faster, politicians campaign harder, and students study more for college entrance exams when they know that they are competing against others. Scientists are no exception. Some scientists are motivated by the sense of competition offered by the community (e.g., rival teams racing to unlock the sequence of the human genome). Similarly, the community offers scientists the prospect of recognition from their peers. In science, achievement is usually measured, not in terms of money or titles, but in terms of respect and esteem from colleagues. The idea of uncovering a new line of evidence relating to the Big Bang is motivating in and of itself, but many scientists also appreciate the respect from other scientists that making such a discovery would engender. In science, both competition and recognition from the community encourage going out on a limb, testing a new idea, creative thinking, and plain old hard work.

			
				

Division of labor.
 Science is simply too broad for an individual on his or her own to handle! Even research within a single narrow field (e.g., cellular biology) may cover an immense array of specialized topics, from the chemical details of decoding DNA to cellular communication. That specialized knowledge is divided up among different researchers, who may then share their expertise by working together. Collaborations and division of labor are increasingly important today, as our scientific understanding, techniques, and technologies expand. There's simply more to know than ever before! And as we learn more about the world, more research is performed at the intersections of different fields: chemical reactions within cellular organelles, the mathematics of protein folding, the interplay between Earth's geologic history and biological evolution, or the physics of snail locomotion. Such cross-disciplinary studies are better approached by a team of experts from different fields than by a single individual struggling to keep up-to-date with too many topics.


A cumulative knowledge base. 
Science builds on itself. We wouldn't have general relativity if we didn't have classical mechanics. And we wouldn't have classical mechanics if we didn't have Galileo’s studies of motion and revolutionary ideas about astronomy. A similar deep history spanning hundreds of years could be given for almost any scientific idea. The scientific community provides the cumulative knowledge base on which science is built.

Scrutiny. 
Participating in the scientific community involves scrutinizing the work of others and allowing your own work to be similarly evaluated by your peers. This system of checks and balances verifies the quality of scientific research and assures that evidence is
