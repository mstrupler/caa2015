discussing the merits, challenges and drawbacks that the FOSS movement in archaeology has brought to the wider discipline
 ->  the actual impact of FOSS on archaeological practice


If 10 years ago it seemed largely irrelevant and out of scope to adopt FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), the setting dramatically changed. Nowadays to address methodological and theoretical issues in archaeology, FOSS are attractive and promise access to powerful toolboxes accompanied with lifelong sustainability. 
* An unexpected or unintended outgrowth of the adoption of FOSS is the interaction with FOSS Communities and the philosophy of software development. Such communities "are a global melting pot of diverse professions and skills that contribute to the progression of the goals represented by the software" (Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, s.v. "Humanitarian-FOSS"). Thus, archaeologist adopting FOSS deals with free, informal and wider communities, so-called FOSS communities. Each software or a specific package develops a community maintaining the software, providing advices, case examples, advertising and developing new tools. Looking for help, new ideas, possibilities of new tasks, reading or collaborate in the development of FOSS give access for archaeologist to others, less formal, but scientific communities.*
Platforms like Wikipedia or Stack Overflow challenge scientific communication and the reward principle driven by the traditional academic. This paper addresses how FOSS and FOSS-communities provide a common language and goal through which foreign disciplines are revisited. It also takes this different perspectives to look how this framework could enrich and challenge science and more specifically archaeological research.




Intro:
1-2: Science Community ->  Diversity, innovation are needed for science
3-4: FOSS and Free Science  -> Community play a role
What happend when you mix the communities of FOSS and Archaeology?
-> Change the norm: reproducibiltiy

5-6: From REUSE  (FOSS Broadly) to Reproducibility
    -> Release of Data and more and more Raw data
    with an appropriate Licences
The existence of Free Software relies on intellectual property and licensing law.


7: Publication

6-7: reuse of Code as a tool. Mandatory (GNU Licence)
    -> R: CA, PCA, LDA, 
    Calcolatory R

8-9: Quick adaptation of Ideas from other discipline
    -> Diversity make strength
    -> Innovation for new problems




Archaelogical Science as Community Enterprise
 
Good morning, my name is Néhémie, I am a PhD student in Near Eastern Archaeology working on the Bronze Age Capital of the Hittite, Hattusa, in Central Anatolia Turkey - So far for the self-promotion. I am going to explore the ways FOSS impact on the concept of reuse and mixing of Knowledge in archaeology and the challenges for scholars, especialy the young one.  This will provide us with a background to look closer at the impact of Reproducibility in Archaeology, for wich I will show some example mainly with R.

MOTIVATION:  I am always diaspointed  when I speak of FS: reaction are sometimes really violent ... and with the Session abstract: no one see an impact on archaeology? My concerne when I talk about Libre Software is people don't know / prefere to ignore how already FS influenced scientific research in general. It's important to make statement the FS is challenging scientific research in general and show how that's happening in Archaoelogy. 


Summary: In this talk we will progress as follow: 
    First I will introduce the notion of Scientific Community 
    Then I will concentrate on the parallel of Scientific Research and Community with FOSS ...
    in order to examine the concept of Reuse , modulation and Reproducibtily
    Finnaly I will show 3 examples to illustrate impact of the FOSS movement on Archaeology ...
    before conlcuding



I will begin my Talk by briefly outlining what is The Scientific community to make the parallel and the difference with FS more apparent. 

1) The scientific community: Why is the community so important?
Sience is cumulative even  if how exactly sienctific knowledge accumulate is not clear. In any case it is a community endeavour and community make the scientific knowledge accumulating and becoming "stable" faster. (I choosed the word "stable" to avoid "truth" and in reference to the process of establishing a fact (Latour and other,) 
-> Diversity makes the difference

Point of views
"Scientists from diverse backgrounds bring many points of view to bear on scientific problems.  Scientists have different strengths and different interests. Not only do people from different backgrounds choose to investigate different questions, but they may approach the same question in different ways. "

Diversity invigorates problem solving. 
"A diverse community is better able to generate new research methods, explanations, and ideas, which can help science over challenging hurdles and shed new light on problems. Science benefits from practitioners with diverse beliefs, backgrounds, and values to balance out the biases that might occur if science were practiced by a narrow subset of humanity. Scientists strive to be impartial and objective in their assessments of scientific issues, but in those occasional cases in which personal biases sneak in, they are kept in check by a diverse scientific community."




2)Functions served by the community

Inspiration. 
"Community-level interactions encourage innovation and spark ideas about new lines of evidence, new applications, new questions, and alternate explanations. "

Motivation.
"Community offers scientists the prospect of recognition from their peers. In science, achievement is usually measured, not in terms of money or titles, but in terms of respect and esteem from colleagues."
			
A cumulative knowledge base. 
"Science builds on itself. We wouldn't have general relativity if we didn't have classical mechanics. And we wouldn't have classical mechanics if we didn't have Galileo’s studies of motion and revolutionary ideas about astronomy. A similar deep history spanning hundreds of years could be given for almost any scientific idea. The scientific community provides the cumulative knowledge base on which science is built."

Scrutiny. 
"Participating in the scientific community involves scrutinizing the work of others and allowing your own work to be similarly evaluated by your peers. This system of checks and balances verifies the quality of scientific research and assures that evidence is "

=I’d like to recap on the Scientific Community: it's the communication and the open process that make it stronger. It's not the claim of a unique researcher that make science strong and reliable but tue scrutinity and critics of the peers. Now I would like to move on to FOSS




3) FOSS and Free Science

Free Software share a lot of characteristic of the science: it has peer review, open data subject to validation and replication, and a culture of credit, civility and reputation. The motivations to do Science or FS is often seen to been in many aspects similar: it's a based on the reputation you earn with your work and there is in both case an ethic to attribuate the work.  (Kelty 2001)

In this process of credit and reputation, researcher make their work available to others and becomes indentified with their work. You make then a citation  to aknowledge reuse of idea / code / concept ... In the FOSS movement you publish the code and if you reused it so you accredite the author.  and in science there is all a process of citation

"the circumstance that the more widely scientists make their intellectual property available to others, the more securely it becomes identified as their property. For science is public not private knowledge. Only by publishing their work can scientists make their contribution (as the telling word has it) and only when it thus becomes part of the public domain of science can they truly lay claim to it as theirs. For the claim resides only in the recognition of the source of the contribution by peers" [@Garfield1979]  (after Kelty 2001).

Free Software and Science are based on the same principle of cumulative knowledge and reuse, remixing and modulate. But the structure of FS, how project are developped, maintain, ideas exchanged  challenge the scientific research.








4) FOSS Chalenge the Power of Knowledge

Question we can ask is what are the difference beetween Science and FOSS / Christopher Kelty asserted that it is impossible to do (free) science without free software. We can see the same practice of  reuse of con-cepts, ideas, writings, articles, papers, books, and so on for the creation of new objects of knowledge. Then what is facinationg it is when FOSS chalenge how we percieved the finality of knowledge. Free Software are instabile in a way like wikipedia in constant evolution. It interroge what we understand as "establishing a fact" a to stablise knowledge.  

Book has aclimatized us with stabile knowledge and it works as an authority. If you publish same content online and in a book, everyon percieve the book as more authoritative. But FOSS with forks, new version, constant evolution of the source code interroge this concept "How should the authority, stability, and reliability of knowledge be assessed when work can be rendered permanently modifiable? It is an activity that reveals the complexity of the system of authorization and evaluation that has been built in the past. (300)"

New practices of publication with the appearance of new information technologies can render the Knowledge more dynamic: like Wikipedia content can be updated, changed, deletied, copied, fork and so on. Eric Kansa addvocates for a stronger "Push and Publish" workflow.

One of the strong influence of the FOSS movement is exactly how remixing and modulation are percieved and how they challenge us to rethink this possiblities: now a strong movement in Open Access, dynamic publication and a third point on which I would like to focus: Code Sharing and Reproducibility

<!--
Although it is clear that the practice of publication has become denaturalized or destabilized by the appearance of new information technologies, this hardly implies that the work of stabilizing the meaning of publication—and producing authoritative knowledge as a result—has ceased. The tricky part comes in understanding how Free Software is used as a template by which the authority of publication in the Gutenberg Galaxy is being transformed into the authority of publication in the Turing Universe. (Kelty 2008: 275)

However, publication does not here signify finality; [..] the document is rendered less stable than the book-object it mimics: it can be updated, changed, corrected, deleted, copied, and so on, all without any of the rigmarole associated with changing a published book or article. Indeed, the very powerful notion of fixity theorized by McLuhan and Eisenstein is rendered moot here. (276)

It is not a new problem, but one that periodically reemerges: a reorientation of knowledge and power that includes questions of enlightenment and rationality, democracy and selfgovernance, liberal values and problems of the authority and validation of knowledge. (279)

The fact that publication no longer signifies finality—that is, no longer signifies a state of fixity that is assumed in theory (and frequently in practice) to account for a text’s reliability—has implications for how the text is used, reused, interpreted, valued, and trusted. (280)

Free Software is a public of a particular kind: a recursive public. Recursive publics are publics concerned with the ability to build, control, modify, and maintain the  infrastructure that allows them to come into being in the first place and which, in turn, constitutes their everyday practical commitments and the identities  of the participants as creative and autonomous individuals.  (Kelty 2008: 7)

5-6: From REUSE  (FOSS Broadly) to Reproducibility

However, it is modifiability that is the most fascinating, and unnerving, aspect of the reorientation of power and knowledge. (Kelty 2008: 12).
An aspect know higly debated, assuming in the FOSS but just starting in science an Archaeology is reproducibility and sharing of code. 
In FS it is mandatory ... if you can't replicate your software it is valueless. In Archaeology there is no culture of exchanging code until know but it is changing thanks to FS. There has been a lot of work about reusing concept and ideas not tailored for archaeology and mixing with diverse community. I will expose here some of cases of influence of R for Archaeology and stressing the biggest benefits of ths software in Archaeology: 1) Pedagogy  - 2) Blurring the community borders 

<!--
The changing meaning of the *finality* of a scholarly or creative work (Kelty 2008: 270)
Free Software is no longer only about software—it exemplifies a more general reorientation of power and knowledge. (Kelty 2008: 2)
-->



7) Pedagogy. In pedagogical terms, Windows is to fish as UNIX is to fishing lessons. (132)

First of all: FS have a pedagogical aspect that you can't find in others software. Read the code, and more pricesely commented code permit to learn quickly.
The Classic example is Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, but there example for Archaeology too: David L. Carlson -> An R Companion to Quantifying Archaeology by Stephen Shennan. It's making the Work with Shennan books much more easier.  -> Quantitative Archaeology Wiki  from isoa.it too.

This big help to DIY practice and establishing good practice among scientist. It make's learning of R and Statistic for archaeology more enjoyable. Even if the learning curve is steep it's not a wall! FS in archaeology must be more stressen as paradigmatic pedagogical object. 

Now I will move to my second point: blurring the border.



8) Blurring the border
-> Community is important for mixing of Idea and taking input. Modulating and using FS ease the blurring of academic border in imprivisible ways. Using interface like Stack Overflow is an interface with lot of people and not just working as IT or Programmer. And even, they are influencing with ther ethics codes.
As an example, I presented some multivariate analysis during an R Conference in Lyon and I had a lot of feedback. Eventually my dataset and my question ended as a Bachelor thesis in statistical modeling. Border are not just blurring in one way (archaeologist need IT) but in the both way (What are archaeologist looking for?)

That is what is challenging the power of Knowledge and it's transmission. 
-> Modulation 
Modulations happen whenever someone learns how some component of Free Software works and asks, “Can I try these practices out in some other domain?” (Kelty 2008: 16)


10) The Conclusion
    In this presentation I wanted to explore the relation of FS with archaeology. It's a personnal statement but I wanted to explain how FS is influencing my practice of archaeology. I hope to have been able to show that the effect of FS in Science and the perspective it oppens. Even if - I hope - a lot of what I have say is not revolutionary,  this does of course highlight the need for further advocaca for FS in archaeology and I would like to see more debates on how FS challenge Knowledge transmission. I would now like to give you the opportunity to ask questions. Thank you very much for listening.

    




A Generic Conference Talk Outline

    Give talk structure. Some speakers prefer to put this at the bottom of their title slide. (Audiences like predictability.)
    Background
        Motivation and Problem Statement (1-2 slides)

Philosophy of FOSS and philosophy of Science (Free Science, C. Kelty)
Use extended definition of Free Software. Introdcution of Recursive Public
 - Development of FOSS
 -  Is there really no Influence in Archaology? Whole concept of sharing in there: yeah may be not only specific on archaeology
 - Copyright and copyleft are challenging

2) Role of community 
 - Exchange, new ideas -> line of codes // articles | blogpost How To Do | Tutorials ...
 - Where we are lookgin for ideas to cope with big data
 - Not easy to find friend to play with ...

3) Examples
   - R 
Calcolatory: R 
  - Wikipedia 
  -QGIS will be one of this example
(Graham and Mirko Novàk)
LA communanauté qui définit et détermine la qualité
Today we are faced with a situation where publication has become trivial, but verification and the management"

4) What can Archaeology do for FOSS
Philo of FOSS is to give back: aknowledge, promote and engage wit FOSS. Use Archaeology for FOSS.

Price of FOSS conference: is that real ??? 450 Euros ???
-> would have  liked to see "Our sessino is open to everyone with our without monetary retribution"
